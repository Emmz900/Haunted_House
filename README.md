# Haunted House Game

This text based game was created as part of the "Object-oriented Programming in Python" Raspberry Pi Foundation Course available through Future Learn.

The game consists of travelling around 4 rooms in a haunted house, each with at least one occupant. Some of these occupants are dangerous and some are friendly. Each enemy character requires a specific item to defeat them, and some of these items are held by other characters, locked away, or otherwise hidden. Items are collected into your inventory and some can be combined to change the items and use them in different ways. 

Solve puzzles, explore the house, chat to or try hug the characters, but **beware**, using the wrong item can be fatal!
